(DRE)

Odyssey is the only end-to-end platform to scale project development across all phases: planning, financing, procuring, and operating projects. Our solutions solve the key challenges facing the distributed renewable energy industry in emerging markets:

Planning + Finance Solutions: Financiers lack the information to navigate the investment landscape in many countries that most need their support. By leveraging our network of 2000+ renewable energy companies, we are helping private and concessional financiers access projects that were previously inaccessible. We have $1.3 billion of financing for distributed renewable energy projects on the platform and a pipeline of more than US$785 million in active discussions with concessional and commercial financiers.  We also offer advanced software tools to efficiently plan projects, aggregate portfolios and streamline diligence between developers and investors.

Procurement Solutions: Smaller renewable energy companies can’t access economies of scale pricing and terms when buying equipment. By aggregating their orders and connecting them with financing that would otherwise be out of reach, we help developers access equipment more quickly, reliably, and at better prices.

Monitoring & Control Solutions: As renewable energy companies scale their operations, ensuring they are performing reliably and optimally is a challenge. We offer hardware and software to make it easy to spot any issues, remotely control components, as well as provide data back to investors about portfolio performance in the form of customized dashboards for commercial, financial, operational, and impact metrics.",Series A,31619608,2017,$1M to $10M,11 - 50,11,50,Boulder,Colorado,United States,North America,"Finance, Procurement, Project Management, Renewable Energy, Software",https://www.linkedin.com/company/odyssey-energy-solutions,https://twitter.com/OdysseyEnergyS,https://www.facebook.com/OdysseyEnergySolutions,"- Platform for streamlining planning, financing, building, and operating renewable energy projects at scale

We increase ROI and lower costs for building owners and consultants working on decarbonization, circularity, and long-term resilience planning of their building projects and real estate portfolios.

Adaptis generates design solutions while simultaneously evaluating them across various performance metrics from early planning stages of a building adaptation, renovation to construction and maintenance planning. 

Using innovative and patent-pending methodologies, we optimize operational and embodied carbon, salvage value estimation, deconstruction planning, circular design integration and cost-benefit analysis. 

We:

1) Get involved in the early planning stages of a project to assist building owners with decarbonization decision-making;

2) Assist design and consulting teams with achieving decarbonization targets throughout design stages;

3) Validate decarbonization goals during construction and occupancy; and 

4) Track and optimize maintenance, capital planning and future adaptation during the project life cycle. 

Adaptis's analysis results in higher-quality design options when compared to a conventional consulting team. It accomplishes this while achieving a 20X increase in speed, significantly reducing the costs associated with assessing and implementing decarbonization projects. Moreover, it enhances return on investment by over 30% compared to traditional design, analysis, and decision-making procedures.",Seed,5464493,2022,$1M to $10M,11 - 50,11,50,Toronto,Ontario,Canada,North America,"Architecture, Construction, Home Renovation, Innovation Management",https://www.linkedin.com/company/adaptis-ai,,,"- Automated Material Salvage Value and Deconstruction Planning
